# TrackAudio buttons for StreamDeck <!-- omit from toc -->

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This plugin requires [TrackAudio beta 1.3.0-beta.1](https://github.com/pierr3/TrackAudio/releases/tag/1.3.0-beta.1) or later. It will not work with earlier versions of TrackAudio.

This StreamDeck plugin provides actions to interact with TrackAudio. [Download the plugin](https://github.com/neilenns/streamdeck-trackaudio/releases/latest) from the releases page. Need inspiration for how to use these actions? Check out the [examples](#examples) section.

## Action descriptions

| Action            | Description                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ATIS letter       | Shows the current ATIS letter for a specific station.                                                                                                                        |
| Hotline           | Switches active TX between two stations, typically a primary controlling position and a secondary hotline position.                                                          |
| Push to talk      | Triggers TX on all TX frequencies, as if pressing the push to talk key configured in TrackAudio.                                                                             |
| Station status    | Shows the current RX, TX, or XCA for a specific station. Pressing the action toggles specified state for that station. Also shows the last received callsign by the station. |
| TrackAudio status | Shows the current state of the connection to TrackAudio from StreamDeck and whether TrackAudio is voice connected to VATSIM.                                                 |

After installation the plugin actions are available under the TrackAudio category:

## Configuring a station status action

The station status action displays the current status of a single station's button in TrackAudio, including
whether communication is currently active. Pressing the action will toggle the equivalent button in TrackAudio,
convenient for listening to other frequencies while controlling with the ability to quickly turn off listening
to those frequencies when things get busy.

For example, if you are controlling `LMT_TWR` and have TrackAudio set up like this:

![Screenshot of the LMT_TWR station position configured in TrackAudio for receive (RX), transmit (TX), and cross-couple across (XCA)](docs/images/trackAudio.png)

configure the station status action like this to show that RX is enabled and the last received callsign:

![Screenshot of a station status button configuration, with callsign set to LMT_TWR, RX selected, and show last receive callsign enabled](docs/images/station-status.png)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The action lights up when transmissions occur on the _frequency_ of the callsign. This means if two stations share the same frequency (e.g. `PDX_GND` and `GEG_GND`) the action will light up when transmissions happen on either of those stations.

## Configuring a hotline action

The hotline action provides a quick way to toggle between two stations for voice transmissions. This is typically
used by center controllers who have a hotline frequency established with neighbouring sectors.

To use the hotline action start by adding the appropriate stations to TrackAudio. Your primary station should
be added with `XCA` enabled and the hotline station should be added with `RX` enabled. Then configure the
hotline action with the primary and hotline station callsigns.

Once configured, pressing the action will toggle `TX` active between your primary and hotline frequencies.

## Configuring a TrackAudio status action

The TrackAudio status action shows the status of the connection between StreamDeck and TrackAudio, and whether
the voice connection in TrackAudio is up. Pressing the action will force a state refresh.

## Configuring an ATIS letter action

> [!IMPORTANT]
> TrackAudio must be running and you must be connected for the ATIS letter to update. It can take five minutes or
> longer for the VATSIM data source to refresh and reflect the latest ATIS letter.

The ATIS letter action shows the current AITS letter for a station, refreshed automatically every minute.
When the ATIS letter updates the action will show an orange background until the action is pressed to reset the
state. Pressing the action when it is not in the updated state will force a refresh of the ATIS information.

See the [SVG template documentation](https://github.com/neilenns/streamdeck-trackaudio/wiki/SVG-templates) for an example
template that shows the title small and station letter big.

## SVG templates

All image properties support SVG templates using [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/). This enables using a single SVG image across multiple
actions, for example a single image to do custom display of ATIS letters with a station name. For more information on the available template
variables see the [documentation on the wiki](https://github.com/neilenns/streamdeck-trackaudio/wiki/SVG-templates).

## Examples

Here are some examples of different profiles people have created using these actions. Have an example you'd like to
share? [Open a new issue](https://github.com/neilenns/streamdeck-trackaudio/issues/new/choose) with a screenshot and
details of how you have the actions configured.

### Seattle tower

turn those stations off when it gets busy.

![Two rows of four actions. The top row shows GND and AAL809, E TWR and ASA324, S46 and SEA_W_APP, and S16. The bottom row shows Final SEA_F_APP, I for the current ATIS, a blank space, and SEA indicating what airport the buttons are for.](docs/images/examples/sea-twr.png)
